README - partials

These are parts of user guide files.

Most follow a general pattern like this:

* The BuildDocs class in the BioLockJ api package builds a document:
GENERATED/Input.md
* That document is built by:
   * copying the partials/input_header.md file
   * adding the properties table with the _input_ properties
   * copying the partials/input_footer.md file

To edit any of the GENERATED files, you can edit the file in place while running `mkdocs serve` to quickly preview your changes.  Once you like what you have:
copy whatever is above the properties table into partials/<subject>_header.md 
copy whatever is below the properties table into partials/<subject>_footer.md

Run:
cd $BLJ/resources
ant buildDocs

Look at your preview and make sure the newly generated file still produces the appearance you want.  Save the partials/*.md files.
