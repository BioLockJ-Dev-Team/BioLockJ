Render the user guide .md files into html and pdf using mkdocs.

You may need to set up the following software:
# mkdocs 
# See https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation
pip install mkdocs
# 
# mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin (pluggin to export pdfs)
# See https://github.com/zhaoterryy/mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin 
pip install mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin
# material theme (make the htlm and pdf both look slick)
# See https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/
pip install mkdocs-material

# mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin has some additional dependences
# I installed them using brew, if you don't already have homebrew then run:
# ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null
brew install cairo
brew install pango
brew install gdk-pixbuf

# The readthedocs theme is really good, and we may use it in the future.
# But the material theme plays nice with the pdf export.

# render documentation
cd $BLJ/mkdocs/user-guide
export ENABLE_PDF_EXPORT=1 # change this variable to 0 to skip making the pdf
mkdocs build

# Make sure it all looks good before publishing to github.
# The site is published to $BLJ/mkdocs/user-guid/site, which is ignored by git.
# While editing, use `mkdocs serve` to preview the rendered html.
# The serve command must be called from the directory that has the mkdocs.yml file.

# For a release, move the contents of site to the docs folder
mv $BLJ/mkdocs/user-guide/site/* $BLJ/docs/.
# this location is under git control; pushing this will update what is seen through github Pages.
