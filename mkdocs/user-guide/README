Render the user guide .md files into html and pdf using mkdocs.

You may need to set up the following software:
# mkdocs 
# See https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation
pip install mkdocs


# To render the docs, 
cd $BLJ/mkdocs/user-guide
mkdocs build

# Make sure it all looks good before publishing to github.
# The site is published to $BLJ/mkdocs/user-guid/site, which is ignored by git.
# When editing, use `mkdocs serve` to preview the rendered html.
# The serve command must be called from the directory that has the mkdocs.yml file.
mkdocs serve
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

# To render the docs to publish a release, 
cd $BLJ/resources
ant userguide

That should be enough.  EVENTUALLY we may want to export a pdf, and for that we would need an extra pluggin.


# mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin (pluggin to export pdfs)
# See https://github.com/zhaoterryy/mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin 
pip install mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin
# material theme (make the htlm and pdf both look slick)
# See https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/
pip install mkdocs-material

# mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin has some additional dependences
# I installed them using brew, if you don't already have homebrew then run:
# ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null
brew install cairo
brew install pango
brew install gdk-pixbuf

# The readthedocs theme is really good, and we may use it in the future.
# But the material theme plays nice with the pdf export.

# render documentation
cd $BLJ/mkdocs/user-guide
export ENABLE_PDF_EXPORT=1 # change this variable to 0 to skip making the pdf
mkdocs build




An odd thing that I haven't figured out....
In Building-Modules.md, line 79, the text "addParsedSample(sample)" had to be changed to "addParsedSample( sample )"
or to "addParsedSample(foo)", otherwise, the pdf exported would hit an error in which "IndexError: tuple index out of range".

Similarly... in Validation.md, lines 3-5,
This is NOT ok:
"""
[**Description:**](https://msioda.github.io/BioLockJ/docs/biolockj/util/ValidationUtil.html "view javadoc") Validation checks whether the output files of a pipeline match the [**_expectation_**](../wiki/Validation#expectations). 

[**Options:**](../wiki/Configuration#validation "view option descriptions")
"""
But this is fine:
"""
